# Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. To do this, we used a URL to the GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

## Challenge Overview
Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
